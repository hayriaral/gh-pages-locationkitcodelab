## **Overview**

Location Kit combines the GNSS, Wi-Fi, and base station location functionalities into your app to build up global positioning capabilities, allowing you to provide flexible location-based services for global users. Currently, it provides three main capabilities: fused location, activity identification, and geofence.

1. Fused location: Provides a set of easy-to-use APIs for your app to quickly obtain the device location based on the GNSS, Wi-Fi, and base station location data.

2. Geofence: Allows you to set an interested area through an API so that your app can receive a notification when a specified action (such as leaving, entering, or staying in the area) occurs.

   - Enter: Informs that the device has entered the geofence.

   - Dwell: Informs that the device has entered and is being inside the geofence for a given period of time.

   - Exit: Informs that the device has exited the geofence.

3. Activity identification: Identifies user motion status through the acceleration sensor, cellular network information, and magnetometer, helping you adapt your app to user behavior.

   - Activity Identification Updates: Proactively obtains the current device activity status.
   - Activity Conversion Updates: Detects activity conversion updates of the current device.

## **What you will do**

In this codelab, you will use the demo project that has been created for you to experience with Huawei Mobile Services Location Kitâ€™s Geofence and Activity Identification features. Through the demo project, you will get experience developing a geofence and physical activity identification to the user.
