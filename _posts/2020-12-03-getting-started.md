To get started, clone the GitHub repository of the code and switch to the start branch.

<pre>
<div id="copy-button1" class="copy-btn" title="Copy" onclick="copyCode(this.id)"></div>
<code>$git clone https://github.com/huaweicodelabs/LocationKit/tree/master/activity-identification-and-geofence
<cite class="pln"></cite></code>
</pre>



If you do not have git you can get the project as a zip file:



Now, you’re set up, and ready to implement geofence and activity identification services. 
You’ll be using the start branch, which is the starting point for the codelab. On master branch, you can check your work, or reference if you face any issues.
